# Feedback App Tutorial Project

This project was done following along with a learn React tutorial. It's not an original project but was very good to create in order to learn the concepts of React. Keeping this in my GitHub so that I can refer to it in the future if needed.

This app allows users to add, update and delete feedback from a JSON server mock backend.

Feel free to test it out and see what it does!

## Usage

### Install dependencies

npm install

### Run

npm run dev

This will run JSON-server on port :5000 and React on port :3000
